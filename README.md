## 🌱 Learning & Growth
- DOM Mastery: Handling events across multiple sub-directories.
- Project Scaling: Structuring a "Hub" vs. a single-page script.
- Logic Design: Implementing game states and win/loss conditions from scratch.

## 🔮 Roadmap
- [ ] Add Snake Game with local high-score tracking.
- [ ] Implement Sound Effects using the Web Audio API.
- [ ] Introduce Dark Mode toggle for the landing page.
